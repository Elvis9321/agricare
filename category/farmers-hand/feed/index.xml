<div id="abssec0010">
<div id="abspara0010" class="u-margin-s-bottom">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been extensively applied in farming recently. To cultivate healthier crops, manage pests, monitor soil and growing conditions, analyse data for farmers, and enhance other management activities of the food supply chain, the <a class="topic-link" title="Learn more about agriculture from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/agricultural-science">agriculture</a> sector is turning to AI technology. It makes it challenging for farmers to choose the ideal time to <a class="topic-link" title="Learn more about plant seeds from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/spermatophyte">plant seeds</a>. AI helps farmers choose the optimum seed for a particular weather scenario. It also offers data on <a class="topic-link" title="Learn more about weather forecasts from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/weather-forecast">weather forecasts</a>. AI-powered solutions will help farmers produce more with fewer resources, increase crop quality, and hasten product time to reach the market. AI aids in understanding soil qualities. AI helps farmers by suggesting the nutrients they should apply to increase the quality of the soil. AI can help farmers choose the optimal time to plant their seeds. Intelligent equipment can calculate the spacing between seeds and the maximum planting depth. An AI-powered system known as a health monitoring system provides farmers with information on the health of their crops and the nutrients that need to be given to enhance yield quality and quantity. This study identifies and analyses relevant articles on AI for Agriculture. Using AI, farmers can now access advanced data and analytics tools that will foster better farming, improve efficiencies, and reduce waste in biofuel and <a class="topic-link" title="Learn more about food production from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/food-production">food production</a> while minimising the negative environmental impacts. AI and Machine Learning (ML) have transformed various industries, and the AI wave has now reached the agriculture sector. Companies are developing several technologies to make monitoring farmers&#8217; crop and soil health easier. <a class="topic-link" title="Learn more about Hyperspectral imaging from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/hyperspectral-imaging">Hyperspectral imaging</a> and 3D laser scanning are the leading AI-based technologies that can help ensure crop health. These AI-powered technologies collect precise data on the health of the crops in greater volume for analysis. This paper studied AI and its need in Agriculture. The process of AI in Agriculture and some Agriculture parameters monitored by AI are briefed. Finally, we identified and discussed the significant applications of AI in agriculture.</div>
