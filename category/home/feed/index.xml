<h2>Guaranteed Loan Maximum Interest Rates</h2>
<p>Interest rates charged by guaranteed lenders at the time of closing or restructuring may not exceed the following:</p>
<p>For loans with rates variable or fixed for less than 5 years:  The prior business day’s SOFR plus 6.75%.</p>
<p>For loans with rates fixed for 5 years or more:  The prior business day’s 5 Year Treasury note rate plus 5.5%.</p>
<p>*Note:  If SOFR is less than 1.75%, lenders may add an additional 1% to each of the respective maximums above.</p>
<p>Lenders are not required to directly price their loans on the SOFR or 5 year Treasury.  These rules simply establish the maximum interest rates that may not be exceeded by guaranteed lenders at closing.</p>
<p>** SOFR is the Standard Overnight Financing Rate</p>
<p>You can look up the current SOFR and Treasury Rates by using these links:</p>
